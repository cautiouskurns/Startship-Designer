## Scope Cut Candidates

If timeline slips, cut these first:

1. **Mission objectives** (nice-to-have)
   - Impact: Reduces replayability slightly
   - Saves: 3 days

2. **New room types** (can add post-launch)
   - Impact: Less variety at launch
   - Saves: 1 week

3. **Advanced VFX** (polish, not critical)
   - Impact: Less visual wow
   - Saves: 3 days

**DO NOT CUT:**
- Tutorial (players will bounce off)
- Save system (expected feature)
- Core art pass (looks unprofessional)
- QA pass (broken game = bad launch)

---

**Status Key:**
- 🔴 Not Started
- 🟡 In Progress
- 🟢 Complete
- ⚫ Blocked
- ❌ Cut from scope
